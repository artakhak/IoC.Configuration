Overview
========

The XML configuration file has two elements **autoService** and **autoServiceCustom** to configure bindings for interfaces, for which the implementations are auto-generated.

Element **autoService** allows specifying interface implementation completely in configuration.
Element **autoServiceCustom** allows specifying an implementation of interface **IoC.Configuration.ConfigurationFile.ICustomAutoServiceCodeGenerator** in child element **autoServiceCodeGenerator** that generates the implementation of autogenerated interface implementation.

Element **autoService** is easier to setup, however **autoServiceCustom** allows more control over the generated implementation. The motivation for adding **autoServiceCustom** was to provide auto-implemented interface implementations based on **C#** attributes applied to interfaces and interface methods and properties. 

Elements **autoService** and **autoServiceCustom** can appear in any order under **iocConfiguration/dependencyInjection/autoGeneratedServices** and **iocConfiguration/pluginsSetup/pluginSetup/dependencyInjection/autoGeneratedServices** elements.
