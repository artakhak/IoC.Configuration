The main functions of IoC.Configuration library are:

1)  Container agnostic configuration of dependency injection using XML configuration file. The file has section where container can be specified, that will be handling dependency injection resolutions.
Currently two popular containers are supported, Ninject and Autofac, via extension libraries IoC.Configuration.Ninject and IoC.Configuration.Autofac, that are available in Nuget.org.
The dependency injection container (e.g., Autofac, Ninject) can be easily switched in configuration file.

In addition, the configuration file has sections for settings, plugins, startup actions, dynamically generated implementations of interfaces (see autoService elements under  iocConfiguration/dependencyInjection/autoGeneratedServices in example configuration files in GitHub test projects in https://github.com/artakhak/IoC.Configuration/tree/master/IoC.Configuration.Tests).
  
2) Container agnostic configuration of dependency injection in code. 

The bindings are specified using IoC.Configuration chained methods, however the actual resolutions are done using one of the popular dependency injection containers, Ninject and Autofac, via extension libraries IoC.Configuration.Ninject and IoC.Configuration.Autofac.
