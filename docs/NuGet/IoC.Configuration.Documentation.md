Detailed documentation on IoC.Configuration is available at [http://iocconfiguration.readthedocs.io](http://iocconfiguration.readthedocs.io).
   Note, details on V2.0.0 features will be added soon in [http://iocconfiguration.readthedocs.io](http://iocconfiguration.readthedocs.io).
   
Source code can be found at [https://github.com/artakhak/IoC.Configuration](https://github.com/artakhak/IoC.Configuration).

There is a test project **IoC.Configuration.Tests** at this location, demonstrating how to do file and code based configuration of dependency injection (the examples use **IoC.Configuration.Autofac** and **IoC.Configuration.Ninject** extensions available in NuGet).
The test project has a sample XML configuration file for type bindings (and for providing some other functionality), which demonstrates most features of **IoC.Configuration**. 
The sample configuration file can be downloaded at [https://github.com/artakhak/IoC.Configuration/blob/master/IoC.Configuration.Tests/IoCConfiguration_Overview.xml](https://github.com/artakhak/IoC.Configuration/blob/master/IoC.Configuration.Tests/IoCConfiguration_Overview.xml).

The XML configuration file is validated against schema file **IoC.Configuration.Schema.2F7CE7FF-CB22-40B0-9691-EAC689C03A36.xsd**.
The schema file along with a template XML configuration file can be found in folder
**IoC.Cnfiguration.Content** in package directory or at [https://github.com/artakhak/IoC.Configuration/tree/master/IoC.Configuration/IoC.Configuration.Content](https://github.com/artakhak/IoC.Configuration/tree/master/IoC.Configuration/IoC.Configuration.Content).
